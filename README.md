##### The repository I'm interested
I am a I am a novice at computers and programming. And the author of this repository was a novice, too. He didn't know a stack from a heap, Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to traverse a graph. If he had to code a sorting algorithm, he can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good. Every data structure he's ever used was built into the language, and he didn't know how they worked under the hood at all. He's never had to manage memory unless a process he was running would give an "out of memory" error, and then he'd have to find a workaround. he've used a few multidimensional arrays in his life and thousands of associative arrays, but he's never created data structures from scratch.
